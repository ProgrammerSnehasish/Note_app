# Note_app
In this repository I have stored all the code needed to build a Note Taking App.
I have developed a partially functional note-taking app using FlutterFlow. Due to a short deadline, the project is not fully completed, but I have made efforts to implement key features for efficient note management.

Features Implemented & Planned Enhancements:
Streamlined Note Management: The app provides an intuitive interface for creating, editing, and auto-saving text notes, with options for local or lightweight backend storage.
Organizational Tools: Basic features like folders, tags, or color-coded categories were considered, along with a simple search functionality.
Enhanced User Experience (Optional): A minimalist design approach was followed, with potential plans for dark mode, checklists, and reminders to improve usability.
Customization: Additional features can be integrated based on user preferences.
I will also provide screenshots of my application to showcase its design and functionality.
